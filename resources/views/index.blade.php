                    Nigeria has a lot of historic empires and cultures compared to other countries in Africa. The history of Nigeria can be traced
                    back to as early as 11,000 BC when a number of ancient African communities inhabited the area that now makes Nigeria.
                    The greatest and the well-known empire that ruled the region before the British arrived was the Benin Empire whose ruler
                    was known as Oba of Benin. Other tribes such as the Nri Kingdom also settled in the country, especially in the Eastern
                    side. The Songhai Empire also settled in some of the country’s territory. By the 11th century, Islam had arrived in Nigeria
                    via the Hausa States. In 1851, the British forces seized Lagos, which was later annexed officially in 1861. In 1901,
                    Nigeria was made a British protectorate and was colonized until 1960, when the country gained independence. Nigeria has
